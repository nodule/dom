# Ok somehow this doesn't work
# it should though queue/index etc. bug.

# debug does not seem to report the integer to string error
# although it takes place.
# toString fixes this.
#
# Another rather fun observation is that html is not async yet it
# seems to perform ok. there is definitly queing taking place.
# I did not expect this to perform at all. Maybe it's because
# Mouse move can still be considered slow data.
# What I would now like to show on the page is the queue stats.
# Sync means, we run the node and when the node is finished
# the next is allowed to do setHtml, I did not expect this to perform at all.
# ok handlebars, how to make that fast..
#MouseMove event [y] -> [x] in toString out -> html SetHtml
#MouseMove event [x] -> msg Log

'' -> :start Actor qm -> msg Log

#MouseMove event [clientX] -> msg Log
#MouseMove event [clientY] -> msg Log
#MouseMove event [keyCode] -> msg Log
#MouseMove event [toElement] -> msg Log
#MouseMove event [fromElement] -> msg Log2(console/log)
