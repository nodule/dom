# Ok, now what's unique about Actor pm
# Process Manager is it has access to all processes within the system.
# this means from any graph, you can pick processes from other graphs
# if you would like to. you could then truly say, you are programming..
# within .fbp :-)
# within graphs the name is unique so call them by name.
# or just query the processes for properties.
